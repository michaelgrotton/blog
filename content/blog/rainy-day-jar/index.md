This post is loosely inspired by Dan Abramov's [Things I Don't Know as of 2018]("https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/"), which is a long list of things that Dan doesn't know. Dan made his list with a mission, which he writes is to use his position as a senior software engineer with a significant online following to break down imposter syndrome and unrealistic expectations of engineers. I just like the idea of having a big list of things I am interested in but don't know much about, and would like to get around to knowing more about, for no other purpose except to have these interests on paper for the future. A rainy day jar of interests if you will! I have also listed the things I am currently learning below everything I want to get to in the future.

For the TL;DR version just follow the section titles and the **bold**

 **Final note:** If you are someone viewing this site in order to vet me for a software position and are overwhelmed by everything I seemingly do not know, please be sure to check out some of the things I do know by viewing my [projects](https://www.michaelgrotton.xyz/projects) and [blog](https://www.michaelgrotton.xyz/blog) (you can filter the posts by a technical tag of your choice).

## Rainy Day Jar

---

*Technical Things:*

**Flask:** I want to try doing web development in a language I more traditionally hear associated with backend web development like Python. I want to start with Flask because it seems flexible, doesn't have strict conventions (so I can feel like I'm also working on Python), and I have seen some good tutorials out there.

**Kaggle competition:** Kaggle competitions look like fun, especially if you work with someone else, and I think that it would be instructive for me to work with more real-world, messy data sets.

**Design:** I enjoy design, and I would love a good book on it to help guide me. I really just go off my gut right now, which I don't think is bad, but I need guidance to know what to do when my gut is not satisfied. I also want to dig into the design aspects of what makes a good visualization.

*Non-Technical Things (hobbies):*

**Making lots of different kinds of breads:** I can make a mean Tartine Country Loaf currently and some sourdough bagels, but I want to expand into other kinds of breads and get better at maintaining a starter.

**Visual Art:** I like the style of [Arturo Torres](http://www.arturodraws.com/work.html) and this [article](https://dynamic.hs.fi/2019/laurimarkkanen/index.html) about Lauri Markkanen (go bulls! And omg the drawings are moving??). I would love to be able to put things from my life into drawings.

## New Things I Am Learning Now

*These are just the new things I am making an extra conscious effort to learn, obviously there is a lot I learn everyday about things I consider I "know" just by doing them. Also, there's a lot of things I am trying to learn because it's summer and I have free time.*

*Technical Things:*

**React/Node Web Development:** I am taking [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/) this summer. I like the idea of learning web development, both back and front end, while getting to focus on one language too.

**Bayesian Analysis:** I am reading [Think Bayes]("https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/") this summer (it's free! Thanks Allen Downey!). I love FiveThirtyEight's pretty [bayesian modeling dashboards](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-march-madness-predictions/) and more broadly, any software that does interesting stuff with data and modeling.

**D3.js:** Finishing up [D3.js in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/d3-js-in-action) by Elijah Meeks. 

 <br/>

*Non-Technical Things:*

**Photography:** Trying to take pictures with [this](https://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_t20/) and keep photo albums through the years, because I could never get into journaling.

**Cooking:** I am working in a farm-to-table restaurant in Maine this summer! I only have two cookbooks, but I just bought [The Vegetable Butcher](http://littleeater.com/cookbook/) and I like it a lot.
