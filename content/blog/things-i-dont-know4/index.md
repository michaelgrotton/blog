This post is inspired by Dan Abramov's [Things I Don't Know as of 2018]("https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/"), but with a different motivation (and half of a different title). Dan writes that the motivation for his post was to use his position as a distinguished senior engineer with a significant online following to break down imposter syndrome and unrealistic expectations of a *real* engineer's skillset by listing all of the technical skills he doesn't know that most people in software development assume he should know.

I am not a senior engineer, or even a junior engineer, and here is where this post deviates from Dan's. I am but a lowly undergraduate student, and most of the time I am not assumed to know very much, but I still like the idea of having a big list of things I am interested in but don't know much about, and would like to get around to knowing more about, for no other purpose except to have these interests on paper for the future. A rainy day jar of interests if you will! I have also listed the things I am currently learning below everything I don't know.

For the TL;DR version just follow the section titles and the **bold**

 **Final note:** If you are someone viewing this site in order to vet me for a potential software development position and are overwhelmed by everything I seemingly do not know, please be sure to check out some of the things I do know by viewing my [projects](./projects) and [blog](./articles) (you can filter the posts by a technical tag of your choice).

## Rainy Day Jar of Things I Don't Know

---

*Technical Things:*

**Flask:** I write below that I am learning web development with react/node, but I also want to understand a way of doing web development in a language I more traditionally hear associated with backend web development like Python. I want to start with Flask because it seems flexible, doesn't have strict conventions like something like Rails, and I have seen some good tutorials for API design.

**Doing Kaggle competitions:** Kaggle competitions just look fun, especially if you work with someone else, and I think it would be fun and instructive to come to more datasets without a clear idea of what is going to come out of an analysis, or what approach is best. So often I am working on a dataset where I already know what insight to look for or what model I should be applying, because I am trying to just learn about the model and how it works, but obviously that's not how the real world works.

**Bayesian Modeling:** I hear this tossed around a lot and I think they do a lot bayesian statistics at fivethirtyeight for their election and sports forecasts.

**Information Design:** Right now I am putting energy into learning how to just build an interactive web visualization, but once I feel comfortable enough with that, I know I am going to need dig into what makes a good visualization and what exactly should and shouldn't I build to get the best results for a user/reader.

**Building an API:**

**Python, Inside and Out:**

*Non-Technical Things (hobbies):*

**Making lots of different kinds of breads:**

**Writing:**

**Visual Art:**

## New Things I Am Learning Now

*Technical Things:*

**React:**

**React/Node Web Development:**

**General Statistical Learning:**

**D3.js:**

 <br/>

*Non-Technical Things:*

**Photography:**

**Cooking:**

*These are just the new things I am making an extra conscious effort to learn, obviously there is a lot I learn everyday about things I consider I "know" just by doing them.*
