This is a personal blog / portfolio / website for technical and non-technical content.

It is built with gatsby.js, and I started it with the gatsby-blog-starter repo, but here are the changes I made:
  * site design, implemented with native css
  * added a tagging system for posts
  * added disqus comments
  * deployed to netlify

todo:
  * clean up css (mostly just navigation.js)
  * make a landing page for form submissions
