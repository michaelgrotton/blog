This is a personal blog / portfolio / website for technical projects and blog posts, and non-technical projects and blog posts like cooking/baking, reading, photograpy, personal life musings, etc etc.

It is built with gatsby.js, and I started it with the gatsby-blog-starter repo, but here are the changes I made:
  * *total* site design/redesign, implemented with just native css
  * added a tagging system for posts
  * added disqus comments
  * deployed to netlify

todo:
  * clean up css (mostly just navigation.js)
  * add an email notification list
  * optimize images
  * fix chrome tab titles
